_Base template for transversal projects in the AI Engineering Career Program — 4Geeks Academy._

> _Instrucciones disponibles en español en [README.es.md](./README.es.md)._

---

## Purpose

This repository is the **starter template** for transversal projects. You will work on real company scenarios (Brasaland, TrackFlow, Nexova), building deliverables that map to course milestones (Web, Programming, Backend, Telemetry, RAG, Agents, Workflows, Real-time).

- Create a template from this repository.
- Replace the placeholder `CONTEXT.md` with your assigned company context.
- Use `skills/` and the directory-level `README.md` files as working guidance.

---

## Current status of the template

The repository currently provides the **base folder structure and documentation skeleton**, plus the following **implemented deliverables**:

| Deliverable | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain logic** (types, collections, search, transformations, validations) | `src/` | ✅ Complete |
| **Backoffice operational panel** (HTML + TypeScript → esbuild bundle) | `uis/backoffice/` | ✅ Complete |
| **Corporate website** (React + Vite + Tailwind) | `uis/website/` | ✅ Complete |
| **Talent Pipeline Tracker** (Next.js App Router) | `uis/talent-pipeline-tracker/` | ✅ Complete |
| **Skills** — Carrier Selection Optimizer, Returns Triage Assistant | `skills/` | ✅ Complete |
| **Architecture proposal** (Hexagonal + FastAPI) | `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md` | ✅ Complete |
| **Incident Analyzer API** — FastAPI backend for CSV incident analysis | `services/api/` | ✅ Complete |

> All previous placeholder text (`CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `company-choice.md`) has been replaced with TrackFlow-specific content.

## How to start

1. **Use this repository as a template** and create your own project repo.
2. **Clone** your repository (or open it in Codespaces).
3. **Replace** `CONTEXT.md` with the full context for your assigned company.
4. **Review** each top-level folder `README.md` to understand intended responsibilities (`uis/`, `services/`, `data/`, `skills/`, etc.).
5. **Start implementing** milestone deliverables in `uis/` and `services/`, reusing `packages/shared/` and `data/` as needed.

## Running the project

### 📊 Backoffice — Incident Analyzer (API + Frontend)

The **Incident Analyzer** lets you upload a CSV file with shipment incidents and get validation results and metrics. Both API and frontend are served from the same server.

```bash
# Start the server (FastAPI serves both API and frontend)
cd services/api
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- **Open in browser**: `http://localhost:8000` (or Codespaces HTTPS URL on port 8000)
- **API health check**: `GET /api/health`
- **Analyze incidents**: Click *"📊 Analizar incidencias"* in the menu, upload a CSV, and click *Analizar*.
- **Test with sample data**: Use `services/api/tests/sample.csv`

### 📦 Backoffice — Operational Panel (HTML / esbuild)

```bash
# Build and watch (generates js/app.js from src/ui/handlers.ts)
cd uis/backoffice
npm run watch

# In another terminal, serve the static files
cd uis/backoffice
python3 -m http.server 5500

# Open: http://localhost:5500
```

### 🌐 Corporate Website (React + Vite)

```bash
cd uis/website
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 🎯 Talent Pipeline Tracker (Next.js)

```bash
cd uis/talent-pipeline-tracker
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to open in Codespaces

When running in GitHub Codespaces, each service is available at a unique HTTPS URL based on its port:

| Service | Local port | Codespaces URL pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Incident Analyzer (API + frontend) | 8000 | `https://<codespace-name>-8000.app.github.dev` |
| Backoffice (static) | 5500 | `https://<codespace-name>-5500.app.github.dev` |
| Website (Vite) | 5173 | `https://<codespace-name>-5173.app.github.dev` |
| Talent Pipeline (Next.js) | 3000 | `https://<codespace-name>-3000.app.github.dev` |

> 💡 Tip: In the VS Code *Ports* tab (bottom panel), you can see the exact public URLs for each port. You can also change port visibility from *Private* to *Public* if needed.
